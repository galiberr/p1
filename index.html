                                                Hi! I'm Roland Galibert and I'm looking forward to this class. I'm pursuing
                                                my master's degree in software engineering through Harvard Extension and
                                                right now I'm a little better than half done with that program.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                I have had smatterings of everything Susan's course offers; I've programmed
                                                in PHP though haven't used an actual PHP framework yet (I was in the process of
                                                teaching myself Symfony toward the end of last year, then I figured I would
                                                just take the DWA course and Laravel seems to be much more popular anyway). I actually
                                                do have some exposure to web application frameworks, having put out a
                                                JSF application at my previous job. Then I used git/github in previous classes
                                                at Harvard Extension, but I definitely would like to get a better handle on it.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                Right now my day job is as a freelance translator; I take on mainly German
                                                to English technical document projects.
                                                In my spare time I like to do karaoke, hike and play bridge.
